# Monte Carlo Integration
Monte Carlo integration allows us to use simulation to make stochastic approximations of functions that do not have closed form solutions when integrated. I was mind blown to learn that this was a thing!! 

We will use R to simulate how we can solve this problem: 

Since the gamma distribution is diffuclt to integrate we will use Monte Carlo to simulate this integration. 

This project will cover:

- How to define and graph a target probability density function.
- How to define proposal probability density function..
- Using Monte Carlo method to approximate integral.
